# Thoroughly Breaking the Damn Vulnerable ARM Router

This repo will contain my exploits for and detailed writeups of vulnerabilities in the Damn Vulnerable ARM Router.
Emulation is done with [EMUX](https://github.com/therealsaumil/emux/tree/master) (will add setup instructions at a
later date!).

Currently exploited bugs:
1) Stack-based buffer overflow in `lightsrv`
2) Another stack-based buffer overflow in `lightsrv`
3) Yet another stack-based buffer overflow in `lightsrv`
