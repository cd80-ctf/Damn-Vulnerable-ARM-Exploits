# Thoroughly Breaking the Damn Vulnerable ARM Router

This repo will contain my exploits for and detailed writeups of vulnerabilities in the Damn Vulnerable ARM Router.
Emulation is done with [EMUX](https://github.com/therealsaumil/emux/tree/master) (will add setup instructions at a
later date!).

Currently exploited bugs:
- Stack-based buffer oveflow in `lightsrv`
